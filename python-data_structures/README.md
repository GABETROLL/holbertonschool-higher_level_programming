# Python Lists & Iterables
## Python: How to iterate, modify and copy lists, and how to work with iterables OF lists
## Directory
0. how to print all items in a list
- how to iterate through a list (or any iterable) in a for-loop
1. how to get an item from a list at an index
2. how to replace an item from a list at an index with another item
3. how to iterate through a list in reverse
- how to use the built-in 'reversed' iterable
- how to check if a value is None
4. how to replace an item from a list at an index in a COPY of that list
5. how to create a copy of a string without it's "c" or "C" substrings
- how to use the str.join method
- how to use a generator comprehension (a generator is just another iterable)
- how to use the "if" syntax in a generator comprehension
6. how to print all items in a matrix
- how to use nested for-loops
7. how to add the first two items of two tuples with the other tuple's corresponding item to create a new tuple
8. how to return tuples
- tuples don't always need parenthesis!!! :)
9. how to find the biggest int (or any item that can be compared) in a list WITHOUT USING 'max'
- look at exercise 0 for help
- short-circuiting
10. how to make a list with booleans that correspond to ints being devisible by 2 in another list
11. how to delete an item at an index in a list without using 'list.pop'
- del keyword
12. how to swap values with tuple unpacking
