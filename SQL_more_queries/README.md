### Install MySQL 8.0 on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
(I hope the best for your installation process,
but the documentation says it's running in a computer with an Intel x86 CPU and Linux Ubuntu)
```
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install mysql-server
...
$ mysql --version
mysql  Ver 8.0.25-0ubuntu0.20.04.1 for Linux on x86_64 ((Ubuntu))
$
```
### Connect to your MySQL server:
```
$ sudo mysql
Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
Your MySQL connection id is 11
Server version: 8.0.25-0ubuntu0.20.04.1 (Ubuntu)
