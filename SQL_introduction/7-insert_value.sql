-- Exercise 7: Add a new row to the "first_table" table
-- with the values being: id=89 name="Best School"
INSERT INTO first_table VALUES (89, "Best School");

-- Note: I can also be done by explicitly listing the column names:

-- INSERT INTO first_table (id, name) VALUES (89, "Best School");

-- Although I didn't test that line, so I can't say for sure...
