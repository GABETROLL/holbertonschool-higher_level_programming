# First Python scripts
## Directory
(All following numbers represent all the files in this directory that start with the number at their left)

The following exercises can be ran like this:
```
(create whatever file or other action that is necessary for the exercise to work here)
export <variable name>=<string>
./<exercise file>
```
0. how to run a Python file
1. how to run a Python command inline

The following exercises can be ran like this:
```
python3 <exercise file>
```
2. how to print EXACTLY: _"Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle_ follow by a new line, aka: how to make a string that contains a quote of the same type as the string's start and end quotes in it
3. how to print an integer and a string together, separated by a space, aka: how to use an f-string
4. how to print a float with 2 (or n) decimals
5. how to print a string multiplied by an integer
6. how to add strings
7. how to make strings that are 'slices' of other strings
8. how to redefine a 'str' variable to be its joint specific slices in a specific order to form a new phrase (it's a surprise ;) )

### advanced tasks
102. how to make a function that is compiled to this Python byte code:
```
  3           0 LOAD\_CONST               1 (98)
              3 LOAD\_FAST                0 (a)
              6 LOAD\_FAST                1 (b)
              9 BINARY\_POWER
             10 BINARY\_ADD
             11 RETURN\_VALUE
```
