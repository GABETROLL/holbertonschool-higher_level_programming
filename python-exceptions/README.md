## Exercises Directory And Their Learning Objectives
0. Handle IndexError when accessing a list with an index out of its range
- list IndexError
- bare except in Python
- Python else after loop
1. Handle ValueError and TypeError when trying to print integer with an integer formatter without using 'type'
- see above
2. Handle ValueError, TypeError and IndexError similarly to exercise 1, but IndexError being handled differently, in a different code block
3. Handle ZeroDivisionError using 'try', 'except' and 'finally'.
- Python finally
- [Defining Clean-up Actions in Python's website](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html) (scroll down to section 8.7)
4. Handle several errors at once using multiple 'except' blocks, and using 'try' and 'finally'.
- see previous exercises
5. Raise an exception
- [Python Raise an Exception - W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/gloss_python_raise.asp)
6. Raise an exception with an error message.
- see exercise 5
## Advanced Tasks
100. Try to print an integer, and print an error message to the stderr if it fails
101. Try to call a function with provided args, and handle all exceptions derived from 'Exception'
- Python unpacking
