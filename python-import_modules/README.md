0. how to import a function defined as _add(a, b)_ from a _theoretical_ file named _add\_0.py_ (it doesn't exist in this repository)
Importing like this should also work for variables, generators, classes, metaclasses, other modules, and probably other things I don't know!
1. how to import multiple functions (or any other thing mentioned in exercise 0's documentation) from a _theoretical_ file named _calculation\0.py_ (it doesn't exist in this repository)
2. how to get and count the terminal arguments fed into a Python file
3. how to use generator comprehensions, the sum function, int casting and list slicing to add every argument
5. how to import a variable named 'a' from a _theoretical_ file named _variable\_load\_5.py_
