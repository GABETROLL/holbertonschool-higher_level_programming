# Python Inheritance
## Exercises by Holberton
(note that these exercises' descriptions are not _exactly_ what I did nor what I was asked to do)
0. Make a function that returns all attributes of an object
1. Make a class 'MyList' that inherits from 'list'
2. Make a function that checks if an object is the instance of a class, AND NOT THE CLASS' CHILDREN
3. Make a function that checks if an object is the instance of a class, INCLUDING THE CLASS' CHILDREN
4. Make a function that checks if an object is the instance of a class that _inherited_ from another class
5. Make an empty class called 'BaseGeometry'
6. Make a class like the one in exercise 5, but with a method called 'area' that raises Exception with the message: "area() is not implemented"
7. Make a class like the one in exercise 6, but with a method called 'integer_validator'
8. Make a class called 'Rectangle' that inherits from the class 'BaseGeometry' in exercise 7, just as a rectangle in math
9. Make a class like the one in exercise 8, but with its own string representation
10. Based on the class in exercise 9, make a 'Square' class
*skip a few :)*
100. Make an 'int' child class with its operators swapped (!!! gasp)
